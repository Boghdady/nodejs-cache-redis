# Issues
1.Caching code is not easily reusable anywhere elese in our codebase
2.Cached values never expires
3.Cache keys will not work when we introduce other collections or query oprsions

# Solutions
1.Hook in to mongoose query generation and execution process
2.Add timeout to values assigned to redis. Also add ability to reset all values tied to some specific event
3.Figure out a more rebust solution for generating cache keys


# Three ways to trigger query in mongoose
1. query.exec((err, result) => console.log(result));
2. query.then(result => console.log(result));
3. const result = await query;

# Expire cache data in redis
client.set("key","value", "EX", "Number of Seconds")
client.set("color","red", "EX", "5")
